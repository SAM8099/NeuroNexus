    ### The Titanic Disaster
    
    The RMS Titanic sank on April 15, 1912, after colliding with an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. 
    Of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, more than 1,500 died, making it one of the deadliest commercial maritime disasters in modern history.
    
    ### Survival Factors
    
    Several factors influenced survival rates:
    - **Women and children first:** The "women and children first" protocol was generally followed during evacuation.
    - **Class:** First-class passengers had better access to lifeboats.
    - **Age:** Children were more likely to be given priority.
    - **Family size:** Traveling alone or with a small family might have affected survival chances.

# Add information about the model
with st.expander("About the Model"):
    st.markdown("""
    ### Machine Learning Model
    
    This prediction is based on a machine learning model trained on historical data from the Titanic disaster. 
    The model considers various factors like passenger class, gender, age, and other features to determine the likelihood of survival.
    
    The model was trained using scikit-learn and performs with reasonable accuracy on test data.
    
    ### Disclaimer
    
    This is a predictive model and should be used for educational purposes only. The actual events of the Titanic disaster were complex and many individual stories of survival or loss were influenced by factors not captured in this model.
